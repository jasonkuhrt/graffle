/**
 * Convenience passthrough template tag to get the benefits of tooling for the gql template tag. This does not actually parse the input into a GraphQL DocumentNode like graphql-tag package does. It just returns the string with any variables given interpolated. Can save you a bit of performance and having to install another package.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * import { gql } from 'graphql-request'
 *
 * await request('https://foo.bar/graphql', gql`...`)
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Several tools in the Node GraphQL ecosystem are hardcoded to specially treat any template tag named "gql". For example see this prettier issue: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/4360. Using this template tag has no runtime effect beyond variable interpolation.
