# Pokemon Schema

This is the GraphQL schema used in all examples throughout the Graffle documentation. It is provided here for reference. For example you may want to keep it open to the side as you study various examples to better understand their context.

You can find its implementation in the repo at [tests/_/schemas/pokemon/schema.ts](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt/graffle/tree/main/tests/_/schemas/pokemon/schema.ts).

<<< ../../../../tests/_/schemas/pokemon/schema.graphql
